##What is it?

**oss-checklist** is a list of best practices in Open Source Software (***OSS***) inspired by [producingoss](http://producingoss.com).

It aims to improve the state of OSS projects by clearly identifying common best practices to facilitate development, communication, contributions and boost project quality.


New and mature projects can use it as a reminder as to what the community expects from OSS projects.


##Why build it?

Because **too many projects are code dumps** with a short README file. 
The *README* file often does not even include useful information such as: install / usage / features / requirements / development status / is the project still active? etc.

**OSS projects often go unnoticed and die due to poor communication and lack of information**

### Development

**Status:** Active. Working on Stage 1 (building the checklist)


<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbtlabs/oss-checklist/master/doc/icons/Misc-Settings-icon.png" width="20"
     title="TODO: extract roadmap to wiki and fix formatting "/>        
####Project Vision and future:
**Stage 1:**

- checklist of best practices and includes examples from popular OSS projects
- build checklist with examples XXXX.com
- promote checklist on websites
 
**Stage 2:**
- oss-quality-analysis
software to analyze existing projects and evaluate the quality (based on items from the checklist). It should answer questions such as:
            - development status
                - recent activity
                    - how often it puts out new releases?
                    - is the project mature?
                    - how fast is it making progress?
                    - how do they handle bugs? do they respond? how active are the contributors? 
                    - how active is the project?
                    - analysis of issues, do they answer questions from users?
                        - should you bother logging issues or not because they ignore / close them without replying?
                - other items from checklist
            
    - oss-quality-analysis-dashboard 
        - promote the checklist + analysis software
        - allow user to show quality metrics easily from their project's homepage (mini image ala bitdeli with metrics). e.g rate at which tickets get addressed
        
**Stage 3:**

    build a template generator for oss to cover all aspects (license, hosting etc. using third party tools)
    This tool should allow someone to "open source" their code (or start a new project) from a template. Without reinventing the wheel, mashup of existing technologies to allow people to choose licenses, apply them to their code if needed, list of tools to upload tutorials (e.g ttyrecord or recordmydesktop), templates for README and documentation. If they seek contributors, how to organize their tasks, books, tutorials etc. 
    Not sure if a wiki is needed in addition to (or instead of) the template generator.
