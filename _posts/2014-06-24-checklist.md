- awareness A key issue in
any collaborative activity is awareness, or -Yï¿½knowing what is going
onï¿½ [Endsley 1995, p. 36]. More precisely, awareness is ï¿½an un-
derstanding of the activities of others, which provides a context for
[one-Fï¿½s] own activity-Yï¿½ [Dourish and Bellotti 1992]. Awareness en-
compasses knowing who else is working on the project, what they
are doing, which artifacts they are or were manipulating, and how
their work may impact other work

Stages:
- build users
- build community
- build contributors
- build commercial community
So, driving open source project success is an exercise in building onramps for communities of users, developers, and contributors, and eventually commercial contributors to enable an project ecosystem.




Marketing:
    - attract a lot of users 
        - easy install, configure, usage, 
    - attract developers
        - easy download, test, develop, configure, fix, patch
    - attrack contributors
        - easy howto contribute, guides, communication, pipeline, bug reports, 
        
        
- have blank / work areas -- where you can clearly see what needs contributions / work
