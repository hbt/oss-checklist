## Stage 0 - Before starting an OSS project


- ###Research 
  - *Define* the problem and break it down
  - *Search the problem* and see how people are already solving it
    - Tools
      - google
  - *Search the solutions* for existing projects
    - Tools
      - github
      - codeplex
      - freshmeat
      - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbtlabs/oss-checklist/master/doc/icons/Misc-Settings-icon.png" width="20" title="TODO: document others + add links"/> etc.
    - Enhancements needed in this area
      - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbtlabs/oss-checklist/master/doc/icons/Misc-Settings-icon.png" width="20" title="TODO: suggest"/> X
  - *evaluate* open source solutions
    - reputation (quality: performance & reliability)
    - activity
    - interoperability (ability to mashup systems)
    - support (community / commercial)
    - last stable version
    - documentation
    - maintenance costs (install, configure, update/upgrade etc.)
    - project management / contributors (howto contribute, development processes etc.)
    - license
    - *Tools*
      - assessment methodologies 
      - ossmeter
      - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbtlabs/oss-checklist/master/doc/icons/Misc-Settings-icon.png" width="20" title="TODO: add other OSS software evaluators"/> etc.
  - *mashup up* multiple systems to solve the problem instead of looking for one perfect solution
    - Tools
      - mashableapi
      - open protocols (plain text, json etc.) 
      - API
      - <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbtlabs/oss-checklist/master/doc/icons/Misc-Settings-icon.png" width="20" title="TODO: document "/> etc.
      
## Stage 1 - Starting

- define *purpose*
  - Short, general, ambitious and clear statement related to what it does
  - think big and small - focus on immediate needs but have ambition i.e how others could use it?
- define *roadmap*
  - a set of milestones towards completing a vision
- define *features* 
  - the minimum required to solve the problem and achieve the first milestone
- *name* the project
  - gives an idea of what the project does
  - easy to remember
  - is not the same as some other project's name
  - is available as a domain .com, .net or .org
- short description
  - quick description to decide in less than 30sec if they want to learn more or not. Concrete, limited, short.  Can be be more than one sentence
- licensing    

## Stage 2 - Development
- *open source from day one*
- *explain your role*  - open source the code does not necessarily mean opening your schedule. Clear things up.
  - how serious are you about the project? 
  - can people contact you? 
  - if they log issues, will you address them?
  - 
- *everything in the open, everything in one place* - avoid hiding important information e.g requirements in private GDocs
- *document*
  - features list
  - requirements / dependencies
  - install instructions
  - configuration 
  
- *package*
  - binaries in download section
  - uses appropriate package manager

## Stage 3 - Marketing
- spread the word
  - freshmeat
  - Q&A sites
  - forums 
  - users of related/alternative technologies 



## Stage 4 - Contributors

- *make it easy*
  - small tasks identified in the code and linked to the issue tracker
  - up-to-date HOWTO guides on how to develop locally
  - clear instructions to log issues, send pull requests etc. 
- *Communication channels*  
  - google groups
  - issue tracker
  - IRC 
  - website
  - email
- awareness 
  - Awareness encompasses knowing who else is working on the project, what they are doing, which artifacts they are or were manipulating,
   and how their work may impact other work
- *Forks* 
  - analyze the forks 
    - are people forking to contribute OR are they forking to configure?
- *Issues* -  bugs/features/changes/discussions 
  - how responsive are you?
  - check for patterns in bugs
  - listen to suggestions / ideas in discussions
  - check how people are using the software
  
## Stage 5 - Commercialization

- business models
- making changes and contributing
    - using your employees to make the changes you want
    - offering bounties (pledge/sponsor system)

Notes: 


http://opensource.com/business/13/8/oss-patterns-and-practices
Stages:
- build users
- build community
- build contributors
- build commercial community

So, driving open source project success is an exercise in building onramps for communities of users, developers, and contributors, and eventually commercial contributors to enable an project ecosystem.

Marketing:
    - attract a lot of users 
        - easy install, configure, usage, 
    - attract developers
        - easy download, test, develop, configure, fix, patch
    - attrack contributors
        - easy howto contribute, guides, communication, pipeline, bug reports, 
        
        
- have blank / work areas -- where you can clearly see what needs contributions / work
