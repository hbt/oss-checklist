## What is it?
        
[Checklist](/2014/06/24/checklist) of best practices in Open Source Software (***OSS***) based on existing literature (  [publications](link), <img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/hbtlabs/oss-checklist/master/doc/icons/Misc-Settings-icon.png" width="20" title="TODO: fix link to literature + point to resources. fix publications/books/research links + create pages"/>  [books](link), [case studies][link] etc. )


##Why build it?

Because **too many projects are code dumps** with a short README file. 
The *README* file often does not even include useful information such as: install / usage / features / requirements / development status / is the project still active? etc.

**OSS projects often go unnoticed and die due to poor communication and lack of information**
This project aims to improve the state of OSS projects by clearly identifying common best practices to facilitate development, communication, contributions and boost project quality.
